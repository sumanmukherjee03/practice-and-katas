# Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "babad"
# Output: "bab"
# Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "cbbd"
# Output: "bb"
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "a"
# Output: "a"
# Example 4:

# Input: s = "ac"
# Output: "a"

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s consist of only digits and English letters (lower-case and/or upper-case)


# Algorithm
# we first observe how we can avoid unnecessary re-computation while validating palindromes.
# Consider the case "ababa". If we already knew that "bab" is a palindrome,
# it is obvious that "ababa" must be a palindrome since the two left and right end letters are the same

# We define P(i,j) as following :
  # P(i, j) = true if the substring Si..Sj is a palindrome  else false
# P(i,j)=(P(i+1,jâˆ’1) and Si == Sj

# Base cases :
# P(i,i)=true
# P(i,i+1)= (Si == Sj)
# This yields a straight forward DP solution, which we first initialize the one and two letters palindromes,
# and work our way up finding all three letters palindromes, and so on

# Time complexity : O(n^2)
# Space complexity : O(n ^ 2)


# @param {String} s
# @return {String}
