# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

# Example 1:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

# Example 2:

# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]

# Example 3:

# Input: head = []
# Output: []

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
# -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

# Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :next
#     def initialize(val = 0, _next = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @next = _next
#     end
# end
# @param {ListNode} head
# @return {ListNode}
def reverse_list(head)
  new_head = nil
  while head do
    head_next = head.next
    head.next = new_head
    new_head = head
