Problem : Given an array of numbers and a number k, find the median of all k sized subarrays or windows of that array.
Remember that the median is the middle value in an ordered integer list.

Example :
    Input: nums=[1, 2, -1, 3, 5], k = 2
    Output: [1.5, 0.5, 1.0, 4.0]
    Explaination :
        [1, 2] -> median is 1.5
        [2,Â -1] -> median is 1.5
        ... and so on
