### Bitwise XOR

XOR has some interesting properties and we can use these properties to solve problems.

1. XOR of a number with itself is 0
  1 ^ 1 = 0

2.XOR of a number with 0 returns the number
  31 ^ 0 = 31

3. XOR is associative
  (a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)

4. XOR is commutative
  a ^ b = b ^ a
