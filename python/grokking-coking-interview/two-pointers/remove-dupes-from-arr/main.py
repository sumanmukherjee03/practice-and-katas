Problem: Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. You should not use any extra space.
After removing the duplicates in-place return the length of the subarray that has no duplicate in it.
Example:
    Input: [2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 9]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The first four elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 3, 6, 9].

#  As the input array is sorted, therefore, one way to do this is to shift the elements left
#  whenever we encounter duplicates. In other words, we will keep one pointer for iterating the array
#  and one pointer for placing the next non-duplicate number.
#  So our algorithm will be to iterate the array and whenever we see a non-duplicate number we move it next to the last non-duplicate number weâ€™ve seen.
#  Time complexity O(n) and space complexity is O(1)
