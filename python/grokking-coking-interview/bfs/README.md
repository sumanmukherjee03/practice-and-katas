### BFS

This is a technique to traverse a tree.

For any problem involving a BFS traversal or level-by-level order traversal of a graph
makes use of a Queue to keep track if the nodes in that level before jumping on to the next level.
The space complexity of the algo will be O(W) where W is the maximum number of nodes on any level.
