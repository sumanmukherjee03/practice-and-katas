Problem : Given a positive integer k and string num that represents a positive integer, return a string that is the smallest num after removing k digits.
          Note that input and output both cant contain leading 0 unless it is the number 0 itself.

Example :
    Input : "825563", k=2
    Output : "2553"

    Input : "83866", k=3
    Output : "36"

    Input : "4000235", k=1

#  Some properties to note when forming a number from digits.
#  Lets say we have some random digits 3, 6, 5, 9.
#  The smallest number will be the number where these digits are sorted, ie, 3569. Although there are n! combinations of it mathematically.
#  It is also necessary to realize that the position of a digit determines it's weight.
#  Meaning even if 9 is greater than 3, it has more weight because 3 is left of 9. so, the more left a digit is, the more weight it has.
#
#  Armed with this knowledge, when we attack the problem above, there is a greedy approach we can take.
#  As we traverse the digits, if the current digit we are considering is smaller than the digit that came just before it,
#  we can delete that digit and replace it with the current digit. Repeatedly do this until either we have done k deletions
#  or have reached a previous digit that is smaller than the current digit.
#  For example : Take 26378491 and k = 3
#  Keep 2, keep 6 - 26
#  When considering 3, 3 is smaller than 6. So, remove 6 and the current number becomes 23. k becomes 2.
#  Next take 7, take 8. Current number is 2378.
#  When we consider 4, again 4 is smaller than 8. So, remove 8. 4 is smaller than 7, so remove 7.
#  k becomes 0 and also 3 < 4. So, we stop. Number is 234. k = 0.
#  Now, take the rest of the digits as is - 23491. That's our final solution.
#
#  As you can see the greedy solution is based on the fact that we are aiming to reach a sorted digits solution. Or at least part way there.
#  And we traverse the digits left to right because the left most digits have the most weight.
#
#  Since we are inspecting the last element and then the one before it, we need a last in first out data structure. Stack is perfect here.
#  Time complexity of this is O(n)

        stack.append(d)

    #  This is to handle the case where the input string is sorted or the elements in the stack at the surrent state are sorted.
    #  For example you could end up having 2 same digits. They might end up in the stack. Which is fine, but k might not be 0 yet.
