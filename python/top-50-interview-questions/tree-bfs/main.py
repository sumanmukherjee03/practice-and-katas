#  Problem : Given a tree print it'sÂ output in BFS order, ie one level at a time going from left to right

#  In a binary tree, to access a node we need access to it's parent.
#  So, when printing in BFS, we print the root element first, but we need to store it's children somewhere
#  so that we dont lose access to them later on and we can pick them out again and start exploring.
#  The best data structure to do this is a queue.
#  So, print root -> push neighbours to queue -> dequeue from queue and explore
#  Time complexity and space complexity is O(n)
