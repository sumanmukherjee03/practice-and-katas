# This gateway object confgures istio to listen to port 80 from external sources and forward traffic into the cluster.
# If the gateway is exposed via nodeport on the istio-ingressgateway service in istio-namespace,
# then that node port is being forwarded to port 80 on the ingressgateway service and from the ingressgateway
# service in the istio namespace to the pods with label istio=ingressgateway.
